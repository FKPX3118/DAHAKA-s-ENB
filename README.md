# DAHAKA-s-ENB

DAHAKA is an ENB preset with multiple weather settings for COT (Climates Of Tamriel). It also contains an .esp file which modifies the standard COT weathers.

The installation supports MO (Mod Organizer) and NMM (Nexus Mod Manager). With the .fomod file you can easily choose the quality level, color level, the focus length in DOF, optional water plugin and a bunch of ENBlens styles.

This ENB is designed for Climates Of Tamriel 5.0 and Enhanced Lights and FX 2.0+.
